> - I called the math department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to find out the proper way to count and whether zero is a real number. Apparently, counting is not MIT's forte. I was told that no one in the math department would comment on that topic. As for zero, a department administrator said, "Our people are interested more in numbers invented after 1972." He told me I needed a number theorist.

In this sense the study of geometric group theory is a part of culture, and reminds me of several things that Georges de Rham practiced on many occasions, such as teaching mathematics, reciting Mallarmé, or greeting a friend.

#### Notations

- The **set of all prime numbers** $$\wras \P$$ $$\textcolor{\blue}{:=} \{p \in \N \mid p$$ is a prime number $$\}$$

- $$\N^{+} \textcolor{\blue}{:=} \{1, 2, 3, 4 \ldots\}$$.

- The **quotient set defined an equivalence relation $$\sim$$** $$\textcolor{\blue}{=:}$$ $$X / \sim$$ $$\textcolor{\blue}{:=} $$ $$\left\{[x]_\sim \mid x \in X\right\}$$ where $$[x]_\sim$$ is **the equivalence class of $$x$$** \textcolor{blue}{:=} $$\{y\in X \mid y \sim x\}$$.
